HTML Simple Redirect

This repository contains a simple HTML file designed to automatically redirect users to a specified URL when the file is accessed via a browser. This project demonstrates a minimalist approach to creating an automatic redirect using pure HTML and JavaScript.

Features

Lightweight and Fast: The HTML file is minimal, ensuring quick load times.

Customizable: Easily modify the URL to redirect users to any destination.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Works on all modern web browsers.


How It Works

The HTML file uses a simple <script> tag to execute JavaScript code that redirects users to the specified URL (https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VavzRTb5kg75dNpzjP02). When the HTML file is opened in any browser, the redirection happens automatically without requiring user interaction.
