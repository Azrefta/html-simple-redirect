# HTML Simple Redirect  

This repository contains a simple HTML file designed to automatically redirect users to a specified URL when the file is accessed via a browser. This project demonstrates a minimalist approach to creating an automatic redirect using pure HTML and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Lightweight and Fast**: The HTML file is minimal, ensuring quick load times.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the URL to redirect users to any destination.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works on all modern web browsers.

## How It Works

The HTML file uses a simple `<script>` tag to execute JavaScript code that redirects users to the specified URL (`https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VavzRTb5kg75dNpzjP02`). When the HTML file is opened in any browser, the redirection happens automatically without requiring user interaction.

## File Contents

### `index.html`

```html<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Redirecting...</title>
    <script>
        // Redirect to the specified URL
        window.location.href = "https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VavzRTb5kg75dNpzjP02";
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Redirecting to url...</p>
</body>
</html>
```
